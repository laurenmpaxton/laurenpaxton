<h1>school dinners</h1>



<p class="redp">
    Our school lunches are so, so bad.
    Eating this just makes me sad.
    None of this weird food is delicious,
    And all the lunch ladies are malicious!
</p>
    The chocolate cookie is the best,
    But it is really hard to digest.
    This idea is a great big flop
    And will never ever be on top.</p>
<p>"



    Scary teachers scream, <i>"EAT UP!"</i>
    But how do I drink from the dirty cup?
    I don't have a packed lunch, so I'm not so lucky.
    All this food is super mucky!
</p>
<p>
    I cannot cope with even half,
    In math class I might barf on my graph.
    I always think, "What's that on my plate?"
    This is the stuff I really<b> hate,</b>
    But I do quite like fish and chips,
<u>Even if the ketchup burns my lips!
</u>
